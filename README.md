## <p align="center">**UX**</p>

### **Strategy**
#### User Stories
- As a first-time visitor

### **Scope**

### **Structure**

### **Skeleton**
All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
#### Mobile - Home Page

#### Tablet - Home Page

#### Desktop - Home Page

Full PDF versions of all wireframes can be found below;

- [Desktop Wireframes](documentation/wireframes/desktop)

### **Surface**
#### Design
The design for the website is clean and uncluttered so the user is not distracted from the game they
have come to play. On mobile and tablet devices the game takes up the whole screen with game instructions
appearing in the form of a modal if the user requires them. This helps to maintain a clean design. On larger
screens both the game and game instructions sit side by side. The overall design and appearance needs to be
fun and appealing so that a user immediately understands what kind of site they are visiting. The Nunito font
was also chosen as it creates a more casual and less serious look.

#### Colour
As the site is primarily for game play I wanted to ensure that the colours used were not dull or
boring while also ensuring they didn't distract from the game itself. I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to 
create the colour scheme found below. The *Contrast Checker* tool was also used to check that all content would be
easily seen. The placement of each colour was chosen to keep the site as clean and legible as possible.
- 330C2F Dark Purple
- F7F3F5 Snow
- 7ADBE6 Sky Blue Crayola
- 1F1F1F Eerie Black
- 90143D Claret

#### Imagery
The images used for the game tiles were chosen as they're all bright and colourful but not so much so that they 
are a distraction from the game or site itself.

## <p align="center">**Deployment**</p>
This project used the Code Institute's student [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template). A new repository named **ms2-matchthepairs**
was created which included all branches from the template. The project was developed using the IDE [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/). Version control software [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used to commit and push the code to 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) where it was stored. The following commands were used for this:
- **git add** ***filename/directory*** - This command adds files/directories to the staging area to be committed.
- **git commit -m** *"message here"* - This command commits files/directories to the repository. Commit messages should clearly explain the update being committed.
- **git push** - This command pushes all committed updates/changes into the GitHub repository.

### **GitHub Pages**
To deploy to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) these steps were followed:

- Log into GitHub.
- Navigate to the **Repositories** tab. 
- Choose the desired repository.
- Navigate to the **Settings** tab underneath the repository name.
- Scroll down until you reach the **GitHub Pages** section.
- Under **Source** click on the **None** drop-down menu and choose **master branch**.
- Click **Save** and the page will refresh automatically.
- Scroll back down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
- You'll see *"Your site is published at"* followed by the site link.
- The website has been deployed.

### **Run Locally**
In order to make a clone, follow these steps:

- Log into GitHub.
- Navigate to the **Repositories** tab. 
- Choose the desired repository.
- Above the list of files, click on the **Code** drop-down menu.
- Copy the clone URL under the **HTTPS** tab.
- Open a terminal window in your IDE of choice.
- Change the working directory to whichever location you want the cloned directory to be in.
- Type *git clone* and then paste the URL that you copied earlier.
- Press enter.
- Your local clone has now been created.

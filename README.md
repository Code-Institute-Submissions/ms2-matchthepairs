## <p align="center">**Deployment**</p>
This project used the Code Institute's student [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template). A new repository named **ms2-matchthepairs**
was created which included all branches from the template. The project was developed using the IDE [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/). Version control software [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used to commit and push the code to 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) where it was stored. The following commands were used for this:
- **git add** ***filename/directory*** - This command adds files/directories to the staging area to be committed.
- **git commit -m** *"message here"* - This command commits files/directories to the repository. Commit messages should clearly explain the update being committed.
- **git push** - This command pushes all committed updates/changes into the GitHub repository.

### **GitHub Pages**
To deploy to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) these steps were followed:

- Log into GitHub.
- Navigate to the **Repositories** tab. 
- Choose the desired repository.
- Navigate to the **Settings** tab underneath the repository name.
- Scroll down until you reach the **GitHub Pages** section.
- Under **Source** click on the **None** drop-down menu and choose **master branch**.
- Click **Save** and the page will refresh automatically.
- Scroll back down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
- You'll see *"Your site is published at"* followed by the site link.
- The website has been deployed.

### **Run Locally**
In order to make a clone, follow these steps:

- Log into GitHub.
- Navigate to the **Repositories** tab. 
- Choose the desired repository.
- Above the list of files, click on the **Code** drop-down menu.
- Copy the clone URL under the **HTTPS** tab.
- Open a terminal window in your IDE of choice.
- Change the working directory to whichever location you want the cloned directory to be in.
- Type *git clone* and then paste the URL that you copied earlier.
- Press enter.
- Your local clone has now been created.

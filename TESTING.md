### **Code Validation**
- All HTML code for both site pages was checked and validated with [W3C Markup Checker](https://validator.w3.org/). No errors or warnings reported.

### **Links**
- I manually tested each link on both pages of the site to ensure that none were broken and to ensure that each link would bring the user to the right location.
- Each link correctly changes colour when hovered over to emphasis to a user that it is clickable.
- All external links to social media platforms open correctly in new tabs and bring the user to the expected platform.
- All internal site links work correctly and bring the user to the right and expected site page.

### **Navigation**
- I manually tested the site's navigation bar to ensure navigation ease on both full and hamburger-style menus on different devices. 
    - This was done by using [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and also manually testing on physical devices.
- The collapsed hamburger-style menu correctly appears on mobile and smaller tablet devices; this makes the site appear cleaner but is also still obvious to the user that it is a means of navigating.
- On both the full and collapsed menu, the active site page is in a bolder font and different colour so that the user always knows where they are on the site. 

### **Contact**
- I manually tested the contact form on the *Contact Us* Page to ensure it worked correctly.
- My testing of the form consisted of the following steps;
    - Navigating to the *Contact Us* Page via the link in the navbar, footer or *Play* Page.
    - I attempted to submit the form leaving one of the three fields empty each time.
    - I made note of the error alert that appears upon clicking the **Submit button** (as seen in the image below).

    - I attempted to submit the form with an incorrect *Email Address* format, missing the "@" and with the "." in the wrong place.
    - I made note of the error alert that appears upon clicking the **Submit button** (as seen in the image below).
    <p align="center"><img src="documentation/testing/form-email-errors.jpg" alt="Contact Form Email Field Error Messages" width="60%"/></p>
    
    - I filled in all form fields correctly (with my own email address) and submit it.
    - I made note of the success message that appears upon submitting the form successfully (as seen in the image below).

    - I checked the email inbox of the site owner to ensure the submitted contact form details were received correctly (as seen in the image below).
    - I checked the email inbox of the email address provided in the form (my own) to ensure the automated response was received (as seen in the image below).
